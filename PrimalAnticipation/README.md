Primal Anticipation
===================

**These WeakAuras are deprecated. Please use [this
AddOn](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/primalanticipation) instead.**

You probably got here because you watched [this video](http://youtu.be/6vlZt7Gs8XU).

You can find the import strings for the set of WeakAuras shown in the video in the `import_strings`
subdirectory. If you're interested in the code take a look at `primal_anticipation.lua`.
